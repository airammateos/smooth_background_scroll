## Reporting issues & features requests

If you notice any bugs in the library, see some code that can be improved, or have features you would like to be added, please create a [bug report](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.md) or a [feature request](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/new?template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md)!

If you want to open a PR that fixes a bug or adds a feature, then we can't thank you enough! It is definitely appreciated if an issue has been created before-hand so it can be discussed first.
